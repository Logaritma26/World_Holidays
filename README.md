# World_Holidays

This app, which I coded %100 with Kotlin, gives you information about the countries, their public holidays, and long weekends that conflict with some other holidays. 

I used RxKotlin, Room, Retrofit, Navigation, Coroutines, MVVM architecture, and Live Data to learn how it is all working.
